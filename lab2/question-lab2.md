### Questions for lab 2

#### Part 1)

**How are the textures coordinates mapped on the bunny? Can you see how they vary over the model?**

<!--*For every vertex in the model, project it onto the surface. This point can then be transformed to a coordinate system from which we extract the texture coordinates (s,t).*
 *Each vertex has a texture coordinate; interpolate between, look up texture with interpolated coordinates.*-->

 The texture coordinates are mapped with *Linear mapping*
 

**What kind of procedural texture did you make?**

 Interpolated texture coordinates as color
